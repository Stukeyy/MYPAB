These tags will be used to categorise all of your activities, tasks, events and commitments so that your work life balance can be tracked and suggestions made when balancing your week. Feel free to make as many as you like, they can be as specific or as broad as you want, however all tags must have a parent. Every tag made will be related to work or life, but you can make this as distant as you like by creating very own family tree of tags. For example, you could create an Education tag with Work as it's tag parent, then you can make more specific tags for certain subjects such as English and Maths, their tag parent can be set to Education, which has the tag parent of Work, so English and Maths are related to Work through Education. It's not as confusing as it sounds, you can view a tags family tree on its View page and see for yourself.

The activities you create will be suggested to you when you are trying to balance your week, so make sure you add some that you like to do and also maybe some you would like to do more of. If your week is leaning more heavily towards work, then when balancing your week, the application will suggest activities related to the life tag in order to try and balance your week. Be aware that activities will only be suggested after all of your current tasks have been assigned whilst balancing your week as these may have a deadline whereas activities can be done at your leisure.

Your week is split into 3 different sections, Tasks, Events and Commitments. In Tasks you can add any assignments, chores, objectives or goals that you have and want to complete, these can be marked as complete or incomplete so you can track your progress, again feel free to add whatever you want, you can set the task for a particular date and time or even all day, or you can leave it without a date and it may be assigned during a balance, based on the priority you give it. Events are for one off or unique occurances in your calendar, such as holidays or festivals, or maybe meetings and competitions, events are really for more specific occasions that come and go and do not repeat, but again it is up to you how you use it. Commitments are where the fun begins, these are exactly like events but recur over a long time, you can create a commitment which can last over a given range, and an event will be created for each instance of the event outlined during that range. For example, say you work every Saturday, you can create a Commitment that repeats weekly every Saturday for the next month between your open and close time that you have to work and an event will be created for each! All dated Tasks, Events and Commitments will be displayed on the Timetable.

The whole goal is to balance your week, so if the application feels like you are spending too much time on work realted events during the week, it will then suggest any tasks and activities you have create which are related to life in order to help adjust that balance. The suggested events will appear with a translucent background and are not confirmed or incorporated until you double click on the suggestion to make it part of your week.
